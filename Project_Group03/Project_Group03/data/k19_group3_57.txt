Section 2104(h) of the CARES Act says to disregard the pandemic payments for social security. State unemployment benefits don’t affect social security, says Toby Mathis, a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas, Nevada, but social security may be included in how unemployment benefits are calculated.

Is now a good time to move or buy a house?
... Are rents going to be cheaper and more housing available?

It depends. The Federal Reserve signaled it won't raise borrowing costs for the foreseeable future, a potential boon for homebuyers as mortgage rates slide. But finding a home at a favorable price could be a challenge.

While the pandemic has eased affordability, it has also prompted many sellers to delay listing their homes. That’s made finding a home in most markets more difficult as inventory has fallen. Tightening lending standards and limited inventory may create barriers for potential first-time buyers, who also typically have a harder time putting up money for down payment.

U.S. home prices haven’t budged much. One reason why: buyer demand will prevent U.S. home prices from falling more than 2% to 3% through the end of the year, according to real estate search site Zillow – it expects to see a steady price recovery in 2021. There has been a slowdown in the rental market. It’s still too early to see the full effects of the pandemic on rent overall, but prices in some areas are on the decline. In San Francisco, for instance, rent for a one-bedroom dropped 1.4% to $3,450 on a monthly basis and is down 6.8% from a year ago, rental platform Zumper said in its National Rent Report for May. New York City, meanwhile, saw rent rise 3.5% to $2,950 on a monthly basis after dropping 5% the prior month.

Will I still be eligible for the extra $600 after my unemployment benefits run out?
It depends. The $600 weekly benefit may still be paid after someone's state unemployment runs out, depending on the circumstances that cause that person to remain unemployed, according to Christina Taylor, head of operations at Credit Karma Tax. 

If you were laid off by your employer due to the pandemic, you're not in a COVID-19 high risk group, and your employer has called you back to work and you don't go back, you will no longer receive state unemployment benefits, she says.  

You would also no longer receive the extra $600 per week benefit you'd been receiving up until that point. This is because choosing to be unemployed or not going back to work when your place of work is no longer closed due to the virus is not normally a qualifying reason for PUA benefits.

“If you were furloughed by your employer due to COVID-19 and you were called back to work, but you can't go back because your child's school or summer child care program is closed due to COVID-19, you would most likely still qualify for PUA benefits until the end of July 2020 or when your child's care provider opens back up, whichever comes earlier,” Taylor says.
