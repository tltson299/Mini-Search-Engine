A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct. Intuitionists also reject the law of excluded middle (i.e., {\displaystyle P\vee \neg P}{\displaystyle P\vee \neg P}). While this stance does force them to reject one common version of proof by contradiction as a viable proof method, namely the inference of {\displaystyle P}P from {\displaystyle \neg P\to \bot }{\displaystyle \neg P\to \bot }, they are still able to infer {\displaystyle \neg P}\neg P from {\displaystyle P\to \bot }P\to \bot . For them, {\displaystyle \neg (\neg P)}{\displaystyle \neg (\neg P)} is a strictly weaker statement than {\displaystyle P}P. [47]

Formalist definitions
Formalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".[48] A formal system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some rules on how the tokens are to be combined into formulas. In formal systems, the word axiom has a special meaning different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth", and is used to refer to a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

Mathematics as science

Carl Friedrich Gauss, known as the prince of mathematicians
The German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".[49] More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics "the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".[50] The philosopher Karl Popper observed that "most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."[51] Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience."[52]

Several authors consider that mathematics is not a science because it does not rely on empirical evidence.[53][54][55][56]

Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians[57] feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.[58] One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or discovered (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.[59]
