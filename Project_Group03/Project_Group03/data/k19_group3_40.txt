My pay is based on commission, can I file for unemployment?
Specifically, if your hours have been cut or your office is closed for reasons related to COVID-19, you should be able to receive unemployment benefits. You would file in the state you work.

My unemployment expired already. Will I be eligible for any benefits now? 
Yes. If you are still out of work, you should be eligible for the 13 weeks of unemployment benefits that the federal government will pay, along with the extra $600 federal payment per week.

... I've recently exhausted my unemployment about a month ago, but I'm not able to file online due to my initial claim.

A lot of websites are unfortunately still catching up with the additional benefits  offered by the CARES Act. Reach out to your phone company to tell them your situation. You may be able to get a reprieve on your payment. And continue to call. The log jam will hopefully lessen as more staff is brought in.

Does a moratorium on rent mean I never have to pay rent for that month?
No, it just means the rent is deferred. That can leave tenants with several months of back payments due when the emergency is over.

What is unemployment insurance and how do I get it?
Unemployment insurance is a joint program between the federal government and the states set up to provide some money to people who are trying to get a job but can't find one. The benefit has been expanded by a $2.2 trillion relief package – called the CARES Act – passed by the federal government last week to help soften the blow of the coronavirus pandemic, which shutting down businesses across the country and forcing layoffs of millions of people.

"Every one of the 50 states has an online application system," says Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project.

How much unemployment will I get?
The maximum weekly benefit varies by state. For instance, in Florida, it tops out at $275, while in New York the maximum is $504. But under the federal relief law, everyone will get an additional $600 a week until July 31.

How long do unemployment benefits last?
Some states offer fewer weeks of benefits than others. But with unemployment now expanded, anyone who is still out of work when their state benefit period runs out will be able to get payments for an additional 13 weeks from the federal government.

Those who worked in states like Florida where the initial period is only 12 weeks, would be eligible for the unemployment insurance specifically pegged to the pandemic which tacks on another 14 weeks.

Through these various steps, all those who are out of work will be able to get assistance for up to 39 weeks.

Can I file a jobless claim if I work for myself or in the gig economy?
