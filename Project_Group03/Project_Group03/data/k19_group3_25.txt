In a male-dominated genre, Celia Cruz became one of salsa’s groundbreaking artists. Born in Havana, she moved to the U.S. in 1961 during the Cuban revolution. “The Queen of Salsa” revolutionized the genre by integrating African elements of her identity into her songs. She won five Grammys, including two Latin Grammys, received honorary doctorates from Yale University and the University of Miami, and was awarded the National Medal of the Arts by President Bill Clinton in 1994.
