My boss is hiring people to replace those of us who were laid off. He also ordered existing employees' hours to be reduced by half! Is that legal?
... How can we find out if he applied for the paycheck loan? He said he was but we don't trust him.

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) does not require businesses to rehire the same people that were laid off. It only requires that the loan will be forgiven if at least 75% of the total amount is spent on personnel with the remainder on work-related costs, such as rent, mortgage or utilities. If you believe your boss has acted improperly or illegally, you could contact your local or state labor agency to file a complaint.

Can still receive unemployment if I owe an over payment of unemployment?
Different states may handle this situation differently. But it’s generally not the state’s desire to be punitive. In Kentucky, for example, the state is offering individuals who find themselves in this situation the opportunity to negotiate the amount that is withheld from their current benefits until the debt is paid back.

I was hired, but the company said it couldn’t bring me onboard because of COVID-19. Am I eligible for any benefits under the CARES Act?
Yes, under the CARES Act, people who lost jobs due to the coronavirus before they could start them can get financial assistance.

I’m a new immigrant who got here at the end of 2019 and have not found a job yet. I haven’t filed my 2019 taxes, am I eligible for the stimulus check?
If you are a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident or a qualified resident alien, you are eligible for the payment. You do not need to have a job or other income to qualify. However, you first must provide the IRS with some payment information. You can do that by filling out the form for non-filers here.

Can we receive money or food? My husband was laid off from a restaurant in California and I also can’t work as a massage therapist.
... I applied for unemployment benefits on March 16 and still don’t receive any response or money. How can we can survive? 

Various organizations are offering more immediate assistance, including some specific to restaurant workers like chef Edward Lee’s Restaurant Workers Relief Program. That particular organization is distributing food and supplies from locations across the country, including Sqirl in Los Angeles. Food bank Second Harvest also provides search tool for people seeking aid near them: https://www.shfb.org/get-food/.

Additionally, Feeding America helps people identify local food banks across the nation.

Would I be eligible for unemployment if I haven't had a job in 7 months? I had to quit to care for my mother. I'm currently looking for work.
How unemployment benefits are calculated varies by state, but even those who don’t qualify for unemployment are automatically considered for the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that was created as part of the CARES Act. PUA aids people who are unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic but do not qualify for traditional unemployment insurance. The PUA benefit rate is based on recent earnings, with recipients also getting the additional $600 per week.

I am the director of a small business whose employees were furloughed. With the extra $600 a week plus state unemployment benefits, several people will be earning more on unemployment than working.
Bringing staff back at their regular wage through the Paycheck Protection Program will result in them earning less than they are getting on unemployment. This doesn't seem right. Why would they return?

Several Republican senators brought up the very same issue during the debate on the first stimulus bill passed in March, saying it would encourage some people to collect unemployment rather than work. But both the Trump administration and most Democrats argued the $600 boost was necessary because unemployment benefits alone in many states would not restore their full pay before the crisis. They don’t believe most workers, such as front-line health care responders, would choose staying home over staying on the job.

If you did not qualify for unemployment in your state because you haven't worked long enough, can you still get the $600?
Yes, the federal government has created the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. It aids people who are unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic but do not qualify for traditional unemployment insurance. People who don’t qualify for unemployment are automatically considered for PUA. The PUA benefit rate is based on recent earnings, with recipients also getting the additional $600 per week.

Will parents of college students get the $500 in stimulus money?
No, people aged 17 and older who can be claimed as someone else’s dependent are left out of the plan. In other words, many college students won't receive the $1,200 and their status won't entitle their parents to receive an additional $500.

I got divorced in February. But I filed jointly for taxes in 2019 with my former spouse and our combined income was $170,000. Do I qualify for assistance?
An individual can go to the IRS and attempt to pursue a matter like this at https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment.

Will my stimulus check be taxed?
No. Stimulus checks aren’t taxable income. The checks are refundable tax credits, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax policy think tank. The credits will be applied to 2020 tax returns, but are advanced to taxpayers now based on their 2019 or 2018 adjusted gross income.
