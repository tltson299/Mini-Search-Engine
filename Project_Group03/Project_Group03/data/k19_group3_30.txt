How much extra aid can I get in unemployment now?
President Donald Trump called for a $300-per-week federally funded jobless benefit for workers who were unemployed due to the pandemic, with states asked to provide another $100 a week.

Unemployed workers who receive less than $100 in state benefits won't receive the extra $300 because their weekly benefit would fall short of triggering the state match to get the federal funds.

When will I start receiving the extra $400 in unemployment the president approved?

The $400 in extra unemployment aid for millions of out-of-work Americans is actually $300 in most states. And it won’t arrive for weeks, experts warn.

Americans may just get three weeks’ worth of payments, according to guidance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will run the relief program through its Disaster Relief Fund, following an executive action from President Donald Trump this month. 


After coronavirus aid talks hit a stalemate in Congress, Trump called for a $300-per-week federally funded jobless benefit for workers who were unemployed due to the pandemic, with states asked to provide another $100 a week.

The Trump administration is tapping up to $44 billion in FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for the $300 in aid. But the amount could be cut at any moment if the funds are needed for their usual purpose of natural-disaster relief, experts say.

It’s unclear whether Trump has the authority to extend enhanced unemployment benefits by executive action while side-stepping Congress. It lowers the weekly bonus to $400 from the extra $600 that expired in late July, with states being asked to cover 25% of the costs. That means the federal government will provide $300 a week. And it could take months for states to implement.

My husband didn't receive the $600 federal stimulus, even though he was laid off and receiving a weekly unemployment benefit. Can he still receive those back owed benefits?
... He was called back to work July 27. Who does he contact to get the benefits?

The $600 benefit was due to those receiving unemployment until it ended at the end of July. He should contact his state unemployment office.

How many people collect more money with the extra $600?
More than two-thirds of workers on jobless benefits are making more in unemployment than they did while working, and one in five eligible unemployed workers will receive benefits at least twice as large as their lost earnings, according to economists at the University of Chicago.

I understand the $600 jobless benefit is about to go away. Is that true?  
Yes. Unless Congress takes immediate action, the extra $600 will end on July 25 in every state but New York where it will end on July 26.

Why did Congress agree to $600?
State unemployment programs only cover about 41% of someone’s lost wages, according to The Brookings Institution. The average hourly wage in the U.S. is $25.72. Congress aimed to cover 100% of lost wages given the severity of the recession.


But customizing the benefits to match people’s salaries posed challenges due to outdated state unemployment systems. In March, Congress opted to give Americans a $600 bonus payment to equal the average wage, or about $1,000 per week.

How much can I expect in my unemployment check once that extra $600 disappears?
In some states, the benefit will shrink by more than half. In Arizona, the maximum weekly benefit is $240. In Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee, it is $275 per week. Check with your state’s department to determine what your benefit will be.

Is the $600 likely to be extended?
That’s unclear. Currently, another coronavirus relief package likely won’t be approved until after July, policymakers say.

I have been working virtually as a tutor since the shutdown began. My workplace will soon require that we return to in person instruction. What are my rights in this situation? Can I refuse?
You can't collect jobless benefits if you quit a job because of a general fear of the virus. However, if your job site is truly unsafe, you might have grounds to refuse to return and get financial assistance while you are out of work.

A worker who's particularly vulnerable because of underlying health conditions or a compromised immune system could apply for pandemic-related aid, says Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project (NELP). Also, if you can't return to work because you are looking after a relative who contracted COVID-19, or a child whose school or day care center remains closed because of the virus, you could also be eligible for financial help.

I've called Florida lawmakers' offices to learn if the $600 unemployment benefit is retroactive, but none of them had a definitive answer.

I heard 'it should be' or that 'it should automatically update to be retroactive.' Could Florida be withholding funds?

If you get any unemployment assistance at all, the $600 from the federal government is supposed to accompany it. And yes it is retroactive.

I applied for unemployment due to a decrease in my hours but I was told I do not qualify for any type of assistance.
... I thought the CARES Act was supposed to help. I'm losing my entire mortgage payment per month and my hours have decreased, but I don't qualify for anything, the unemployment office said.

Each state has its own guidelines, according to the Department of Labor, but you may be eligible for unemployment if you:

Are separated from your job through no fault of your own, due to lack of work;
Meet your state's requirements for wages earned and time worked;
Meet your state's additional requirements.
The CARES Act can support short-term compensation programs where employers reduce hours instead of laying off, and employees receive prorated unemployment benefits. But it depends on your state, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax. Some states don’t allow partial unemployment benefits and some are modifying existing laws to allow partial unemployment benefits.
