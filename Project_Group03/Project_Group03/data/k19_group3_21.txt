As protests continue over George Floyd's death and the continued mistreatment of Black Americans at the hands of police, many are looking for ways to demand justice while staying at home due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in police custody May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck.

The horrifying bystander video of Floyd's death spread quickly on social media, showing the officer driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the handcuffed man repeatedly says he can't breathe.

Four officers involved in the incident were fired, and on May 29, former officer Derek Chauvin was arrested, days after the video surfaced.

If you're looking to get involved outside of organizing in person, we've rounded up a list of ways you can take action from home, including ideas specific to demanding justice for Floyd and addressing racism in general:
