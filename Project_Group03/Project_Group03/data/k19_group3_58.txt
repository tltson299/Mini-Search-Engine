I have been furloughed and receiving unemployment. I have found part time work but if I take it, I'll make less than on benefits. Can they only be reduced?
... I know I can't say no to work and I know that if I make more than 50% of my unemployment my benefits will be reduced. Is that based off my state unemployment benefit?

If you are once again employed, you won’t qualify for jobless benefits

Why am I only receiving $516 a week instead of the full $600?
Unemployment benefits, including the $600 weekly federal benefit, are subject to both federal and state income taxes. In some cases, you can elect out of withholding. You will, however, still owe taxes on the benefit come tax time. Federal taxes are usually withheld at 10% and the state taxes depend on your state of residence.

I’m currently out of the U.S. Can I still apply for unemployment?
... I actually came to Nepal for vacation, but because of the pandemic I’m stuck here longer than I was supposed to be.

You can still apply with your state of residence, but the answer will depend on the rules they have in place. Most states have a number of hours requirement or compensation earned requirement prior to allowing benefits along with rules such as being unemployed through no fault of your own, and that you are actively seeking work, according to Toby Mathis, a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Many states have modified the last requirement during the pandemic to eliminate the seeking work requirement, but not all. Some states have added additional eligibility for those who are adversely affected by pandemic, Mathis says.

Why haven't I gotten my stimulus money yet?
... Retired, income below $60000, filed taxes 2018 and 2019, same bank same account and received automatic deposits from IRS before. 

Tax professionals suggest checking the Get My Payment tool on the IRS website to monitor your status. There are several reasons the money hasn’t been received, either from someone hacking the account, a possible debt collector garnishing, to the bank simply denying the debit, says Toby Mathis, a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas.

I just got laid off and I collect a pension. Am I eligible for unemployment and the $600 a week?
It depends. If you are collecting the pension from the company that laid you off, you might not qualify for unemployment. But if you were laid off due to COVID-19, and you collect a pension from a previous employer, you should still be able to get unemployment, along with the extra $600 in federal aid
