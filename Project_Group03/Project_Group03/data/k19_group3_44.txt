With all the binge-watching your recipient has probably been doing these days, they'll probably want a shiny, new TV to do it in style. And they deserve the best, right? The LG C9 TV is the best TV we've ever tested for its crisp OLED picture quality, 4K resolution, High Dynamic Range and Dolby Vision specifications, and LG's friendly webOS smart platform. Seriously, it's like a mini movie theater. It costs a pretty penny, but for any avid movie-watcher, it's completely worth it.

Get the LG 77" Class C9 Series OLED TV at Amazon for $3,996.99

This spring, getting a Nintendo Switch was nearly impossible as pretty much every person wanted one to keep entertained in quarantined and play the sought after Animal Crossing New Horizons. To actually get your hands on one for your giftee, you’re going to want to keep your eye out for one. You can find the Nintendo Switch console come in and out of stock, otherwise the Nintendo Switch Lite is your best bet. Also, keep your eye out for the new Xbox X Series and PlayStation 5, which are set to be released in November and will sell out fast.

Even if your giftee prefers the feel of a "real" book, they'll still appreciate an e-reader to easily access books while stuck at home. The Kindle Paperwhite is still the best e-reader we’ve ever tested and makes an amazing gift, especially for the bookworm in your life. It gives them an seemingly unlimited library at their fingertips and its waterproof, so they can read in the bathtub without fear.

We need more than just a cup of coffee to get by these days, and if your giftee is a cold brew coffee aficionado, they'll love this iced coffee maker from Takeya. We chose it as the best cold brew coffee maker of the year because it was not only the easiest to use, but it also made the best-tasting coffee. Who says iced coffee is just limited to summer anyway?

Whether they work from home or are taking virtual classes, your giftee would appreciate a pair of noise-canceling headphones. The Sony WH-1000XM4’s are our new favorite noise-canceling headphones (dethroning its original flagship, the WH-1000XM3). They look nearly identical as their predecessor and have the same nifty feature of active noise-cancelation. But they have better sound and a more seamless Bluetooth connection that any audiophile will surely notice.
